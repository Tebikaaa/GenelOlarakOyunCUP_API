Hello there, IF you see thaht readme its basically little setup. 

When you clone the repo the projects would install normally BUT there is a requirement, you need to do migration things again cause i am using my own database server and database it wont work on you STEPS:

1. CLONE THE REPO
2. OPEN THE WEBAPP DIRECTORY
3. DELETE MIGRATIONS
4. GO BACK TO LAST DIRECTORY
5. OPEN .SLN FILE
6. THEN OPEN PACKAGE MANAGER CONSOLE
7. AND DO THE MIGRATION WORK
   

after that steps project will able to work on any computer. IF you dont know how to make MIGRATION you can ask to chatgpt or some ai modle it would answer you
